                At Kingdom of Believers Christian Centre (KBCC), our vision is
                to build a people who reflect the life, wisdom, power, and
                character of Christ—men and women who provide solutions, shine
                as light, and influence their world for God's glory.

                We are committed to gathering the unsaved through intentional
                evangelism and transforming them by the Word and the Spirit
                until they become Answers in the society.
              </p>
              <p>
                We accomplish this through passionate soul winning,
                Spirit-filled worship, sound teaching, and empowering believers
                to live out their identity in Christ.

                We uphold a life of purity, integrity, and obedience to God's
                Word. Righteousness is the foundation for spiritual authority

                We express the love of Christ in our relationships, service, and
                outreach. Love is the culture of our house and the atmosphere in

            <p>
              The mandate of Kingdom of Believers Ministry was delivered by God
              to the Set Man, Pastor Gbenga Olusanya, on 9th May 2013 during a
              personal three-day dry fast held from May 8th to 10th, 2013. In
              that encounter, the Lord instructed him to raise a kingdom of
              believers who live the Kingdom lifestyle and who serve as Answers
              in the society.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the time, Pastor Gbenga Olusanya was serving as a Traveling
              Minister with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG). When
              God called him into this new assignment, he informed his
              supervising authority, Pastor E. A. Odeyemi, who insisted he would
              not release him unless God confirmed it personally. After a season
              of waiting, Pastor Odeyemi called him and affirmed that indeed,
              "God has a special assignment for you." In November 2014, he and
              his wife were officially prayed for and released to pursue the
              divine mandate.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following this release, Kingdom of Believers Christian Centre
              (KBCC), the church arm of Kingdom of Believers Ministry was
              birthed. The ministry was established on 1st February 2015,
              immediately after a three-day crusade held from 29th to 31st
              January 2015. Remarkably, God had specifically mentioned the exact
              location where the work should begin, even though Pastor Gbenga
              had never visited Ajeromi-Ifelodun Local Government before then.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since inception, KBCC has remained steadfast to its divine
              mandate: raising men and women who are Answers in the society.
              Through consistent preaching and teaching of the Word of Faith,
              and through impactful annual programmes such as the Believers'
              Camp Meeting, Kingdom Life Conference, and the Easter Growth
              Retreat, the ministry continues to shape destinies and build
              believers who shine as solutions in their world.
