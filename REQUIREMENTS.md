SERMON PREVIEW: THE NAME OF JESUS (PART 1)
By Pastor Gbenga Olusanya (PGO) — KBCC
The name of Jesus is not just a title; it is the greatest spiritual force ever given to humanity. In this first part of the teaching, Pastor Gbenga unveils the depth, weight, and glory wrapped inside the name that God Himself exalted above every other name (Philippians 2:9–11).
You will discover that the name of Jesus carries absolute authority in heaven, on earth, and beneath the earth—meaning no situation, power, or contention is beyond its reach. It is the believer’s rod of authority, the signature that stops what must stop and releases what God has ordained.
In this teaching, Pastor Gbenga explains how the name of Jesus represents everything Jesus is, everything He has, and everything He accomplished through His death and resurrection. When you speak the name, you invoke His presence, His glory, His victory, and His power.
You will learn:
● Why the name of Jesus is every believer’s highest possession (Acts 3:6)
● What makes this name equal to the presence, honour, and dominion of Christ
● How healing, deliverance, miracles, preservation, and answered prayers flow through this name
● How to activate healing and deliverance by faith in the name
● Why your relationship with Jesus determines the results you command through His name
This message will stir your faith, awaken your consciousness of spiritual authority, and empower you to walk in the possibilities available only through the name of Jesus.
Key Counsel: Seek to know His name.
Don't miss this transformational teaching, your understanding of the name will change your spiritual experience forever.

BRIEF HISTORY OF KBCC
The mandate of Kingdom of Believers Ministry was delivered by God to the Set Man, Pastor Gbenga Olusanya, on 9th May 2013 during a personal three-day dry fast held from May 8th to 10th, 2013. In that encounter, the Lord instructed him to raise a kingdom of believers who live the Kingdom lifestyle and who serve as Answers in the society.
At the time, Pastor Gbenga Olusanya was serving as a Traveling Minister with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG). When God called him into this new assignment, he informed his supervising authority, Pastor E. A. Odeyemi, who insisted he would not release him unless God confirmed it personally. After a season of waiting, Pastor Odeyemi called him and affirmed that indeed, God has a special assignment for you. In November 2014, he and his wife were officially prayed for and released to pursue the divine mandate.
Following this release, Kingdom of Believers Christian Centre (KBCC), the church arm of Kingdom of Believers Ministry was birthed. The ministry was established on 1st February 2015, immediately after a three-day crusade held from 29th to 31st January 2015. Remarkably, God had specifically mentioned the exact location where the work should begin, even though Pastor Gbenga had never visited Ajeromi-Ifelodun Local Government before then. A friend who grew up in the area helped him navigate and access the community.
Since inception, KBCC has remained steadfast to its divine mandate: raising men and women who are Answers in the society. Through consistent preaching and teaching of the Word of Faith, and through impactful annual programmes such as the Believers’ Camp Meeting, Kingdom Life Conference, and the Easter Growth Retreat, the ministry continues to shape destinies and build believers who shine as solutions in their world.
